## Usage

**If you want to account for language usage, then run the first bot.**

```console
  executables/Wordle_bot_with_api
```

**If don't want to account for language usage, then run the second one.**

```console
  executables/Wordle_bot_without_api
```

**The first bot is faster, but the second one tends to get the answer in fewer questions.**
